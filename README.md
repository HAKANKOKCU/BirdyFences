# How to
Just open the exe to get started.

- To create a new fence, right click on the Title of the fence, then New Fence
- To remove a fence, right click again in the Title of the fence, then Remove Fence
- To create a Portal Fence, right click again in the Title of the fence then New Portal Fence, and select a folder to import all shortcuts
- To Lock/Unlock a fence, right click on the Title of the fence, then Lock Fence
```
Note: If you lock a fence, you cannot move the fences, edit the title, remove fences, and even modify the shortcuts inside the fence.
```
- To edit title of the fence, double click on the title, then type the new title and press Enter

To automatically start when boot:
- Windows 11: Right Click into the exe file then `Show more options` then `Send to` and click `Desktop (Create Shortcut)`
- Windows 10: Right Click into the exe file then `Send to` and click `Desktop (Create Shortcut)`
- Do `CTRL+R` then type `shell:startup`
- Drag the `Birdy Fences - Shortcut` to the shell:startup file explorer
- And reboot to check if its working.

# WIP
- Add icons for folders (for now icons for folder appear as nothing)
- When locked, avoid removal of fence also prevent renaming the fence, right clock actions on shortcuts
- When doing `WIN+D` avoid app to minimize as well
